HFS: Hercules A Fault Tolerant Scalable Parallel File System.

Initial Design.

Working.
	Server Design.
	Client Design.


Scalability.
	Perf numbers as MDS and DS are scaled.

Fault Tolerance.
	RAID 01
	MYSQL Replication.

	Degraded Operations:
	Recovery:
		Recovery from PRIMARY NEIGHBOR lock block before back recovery, BACKUP NEIGHBOR not thought of yet.

Optimizations:
	Delayed Extent creation.		(Post Mark results with Delayed Extent Creation.)
		Not amortized over writes as small files may need only less than 1 extent.
	Small File on MDS.
	File size calculations.
	Zero updation.

TestBed And Acknowledgements to Emulab.


Performace Section:
	As the filesystem was developed in increment a lot of performance gathering opportunity was available.

Conclusion:
	What performed and is recommended.

Future Work:
	The FUSE needs to worked up.
